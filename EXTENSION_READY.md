## 📚 Components Used

The extension reuses your existing Angular components:

- `EmailInputComponent` - Email text input form
- `ReplyDraftsComponent` - Multiple reply options with tabs
- `IntentSummaryCardComponent` - Summary of email intent
- `RiskPanelComponent` - Risk analysis and flags
- `QuestionsCardComponent` - Suggested questions

All these are **shared** between the web app and extension!

## 🎨 Styling

The extension uses:
- **SCSS** - Preprocessed CSS with variables
- **Angular Material** - Professional Material Design
- **Responsive layout** - Works on different screen sizes
- **Smooth animations** - Fade-in and slide-in effects

## 🔌 API Integration

The extension communicates with your backend via:
- `ReplywiseApiService` - HTTP service for API calls
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/generate` - Generate email reply
  - `GET /health` - Server health check

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear
- Make sure you loaded the `dist/extension` folder, not the root
- Check that you're using the latest build (rebuild if needed)
- Check extension popup for errors: right-click extension → Inspect

### API errors
- Start backend: `npm run dev` in `replywise-api` folder
- Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
- Check `.env` file has your Gemini API key

### CSS/Styling issues
- The styles are bundled in `styles.css`
- If you change component styles, rebuild with `npm run build:extension`
- Check browser DevTools for CSS conflicts

### Gmail integration not working
- Make sure you're on `https://mail.google.com`
- Check `content-script.js` has permission to run (in manifest.json)
- Reload the page after adding extension

## 🎯 Next Steps

You can now:

1. **Test the extension** - Try it with different emails
2. **Customize** - Modify components to match your needs
3. **Add features** - Integrate it with your backend
4. **Deploy** - Later, publish to Chrome Web Store
